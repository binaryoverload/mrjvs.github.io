I went for a super minimalistic and clean design so it does straight to the point.

I included a personality box so I can show a bit about myself, to keep it personal while still staying in cool and professional. A nice mix of playful and informational.

I didn't include any way to contact me because I am not usually available to hire. Maybe in the future I will need the money but right now I'm good.
