        <h1>My personality box</h1>
        <p>Do you want to know me a bit more personally? This box contains all kinds of information about me: What I like, what I dislike, how I view certain things and maybe even some concepts. Give it a try and click on the box.</p>
        <div class="box-container">

                    <h1>Design</h1>
                    <p>I think graphic design is of the greatest importance; It makes a product if done well and completely breaks it when done poorly. If you start a business, you should hire a designer since it does help an enormous amount in marketing.</p>

                    <h1>Celeste</h1>
                    <p>Celeste is a video game about climbing a mountain and I adore it. The way the story is told, the way the jumps are placed, the way the graphics represent emotion. It all just consumed me for a few months and I would do everything to experience it again like I did the first time.</p>
                    <div class="button-container">
                        <button onclick="nextCard(this.parentNode.parentNode);">See another</button>

                    <h1>Habits</h1>
                    <p>I struggle maintaining habits. I find it really hard to do a certain thing over and over again. I just get bored of doing repetive tasks and I can't keep myself motivated to keep going. That is also why I am really proud of myself when I finally do maintain a habbit for a while.</p>

                    <h1>ADHD</h1>
                    <p>Did you know I have ADHD? You may think of it as a bad thing but I see it a skill. My brain thinks about many things at once and thus I can come up with creative ideas and solutions. An ADHD brain is not defective, It just works a bit differently.</p>
                    <div class="button-container">
                        <button onclick="nextCard(this.parentNode.parentNode);">See another</button>

                    <h1>Frisbee</h1>
                    <p>In the Netherlands, there are a limited amount of sports that people play: Volley, Hockey, Soccer. Frisbee - which I love - is not one of the popular sports, most people see it as just throwing a disk. It's quite hard to join a Frisbee club because of that.</p>

                    <h1>Undertale</h1>
                    <p>Undertale is an RPG that is a tribute to the old days. It has nice 8-bit music, enjoyable clich√© characters and lots of playful behaviour that makes you want to be a part of their world. Nothing else to say about other than that I really like it.</p>
                    <div class="button-container">
